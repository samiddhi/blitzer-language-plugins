Subject: Request for Permission to Use DPD Data in GPL Project

Dear Digital Pāḷi Dictionary Team,

I am developing a GPL-licensed CLI tool for language learning that uses Pāḷi lemmatization. I currently use a subset of DPD data (word-form to lemma mappings) in my blitzer-language-pli plugin, which is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 as permitted by your license.

I would like to incorporate this same data directly into my main GPL-licensed project. Since CC BY-NC 4.0 and GPL have compatibility issues, would you grant permission to use this subset under GPL terms for this educational purpose?

Thank you for considering my request and for your valuable contribution to Pāḷi studies.

Respectfully,
[Your name]
